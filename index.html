        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            This capstone project revolves around the creation of a full-stack application using Django, PostgreSQL, and Python. It's a culmination of the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the CS program, showcasing proficiency in software development and design.
        </p>

        <h2>ePortfolio Metrics</h2>

        <p>
            <strong>Informal Code Review:</strong> After you have identified the artifact or artifacts for your ePortfolio, but before you complete the modifications and enhancements, you will conduct a code review to share your plans for modification and enhancement. Your code review must be present in your ePortfolio. Your code review must be submitted in the form of a video presentation or screencast walkthrough. Your audience for this code review should be your peers or your manager. Focus on explaining how your code works and why you will complete the enhancement you are planning; do not worry about getting too technical. Address the following in your code reviews:
            Existing functionality: Walk through and identify what the code is, what it does, and how it works. 
            Code Analysis: Review the code structure, look for code efficiencies, and check for comments and code documentation. Explain your findings. 
            Look for enhancement: Walk through and explain planned enhancements.
            Artifact(s): Provide at least one (with a maximum of three) artifact that represents your growth in the Computer Science program, demonstrating enhancements in the following categories.
            Note: You only need to choose one enhancement per category. You can pick the same course for multiple enhancements.
            You are encouraged to include additional materials in your ePortfolio to showcase the full range or depth of your skills and abilities. Your additional materials will not be subject to grading but will be eligible for instructor feedback.

            <strong>Software Design and Engineering:</strong> For this category of enhancement, consider improving a piece of software, transferring a project into a different language, reverse engineering a piece of software for a different operating system, or expanding a projectâ€™s complexity. These are just recommendations; consider being creative and proposing an alternative enhancement to your instructor. The following are viable course options for this category:

            <br>

            <strong>Algorithm and Data Structures:</strong> For this category of enhancement, consider improving the efficiency of a project or expanding the complexity of the use of data structures and algorithms for your artifact. These are just recommendations; consider being creative and proposing an alternative enhancement to your instructor. The following are viable course options for this category:

            <br>
            <br>

            <strong>Database:</strong> For this category of enhancement, consider adding more advanced concepts of MySQL, incorporating data mining, creating a MongoDB interface with HTML/JavaScript, or building a full stack with a different programming language for your artifact. These are just recommendations; consider being creative and proposing an alternative enhancement to your instructor. he following are viable course options for this category:

            <br>

            <strong>Narratives:</strong> For each artifact in your ePortfolio, you will provide a narrative to accompany the artifact itself. The narrative that you write for each artifact should explain why you included the artifact in your ePortfolio and reflect on the process you used to create the artifact. The narrative(s) should focus less on the actual creation of each artifact and more on the learning that happened through the creation of the artifact. For each artifact, you should address the following:
            -Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
            -Justify the inclusion of the artifact(s) in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcases your skills and abilities in software development?
            -Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? How did you incorporate feedback as you made changes to the artifact? How was the artifact improved?

            <br>
            <br>

            <strong>Professional Self-Assessment:</strong> For your e-portfolio you will write a professional self-assessment. In it, you will reflect on the capstone and your experience in the Computer Science program as a whole. Your professional self-assessment will serve as the formal introduction to your portfolio. You will add it to the beginning of your portfolio for your final submission in Module Seven.
